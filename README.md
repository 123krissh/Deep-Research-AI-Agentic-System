**Design a Deep Research AI Agentic System that crawls websites using Tavily for online information gathering. Implement a dual-agent (or more agents) system with one agent focused on research and data collection, while the second agent functions as an answer drafter. The system should utilize the LangGraph & LangChain frameworks to effectively organize the gathered information.**
